# Robotics Helper

Some messy code I threw together in a day, finds degrees and distance between destination points and outputs the values.

## How to run

- go to [`https://dylandibeneditto.github.io/robotics-helper/`](https://dylandibeneditto.github.io/robotics-helper/)
### OR
- `git clone` this repo to your computer and simply run on any live server you desire
- make sure to set the destination of your live server to the [`index.html`](./index.html) file
